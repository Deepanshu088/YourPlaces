Hello Everyone,
The code is at master branch. There are two folders one is backend and other is forntend. 
Backend is developed with nodejs and integreted with MongoDb. 
Frontend is developed by Reactjs. 
Backend has proper authentication and authorization with restful apis.

This project is not live on heroku becoz it have a image storage system on the server and file storage is not supported by heroku, atleast not in free version. 

Have a look around.
